 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

 Preamble

 The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
 License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
 software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
 General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
 Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
 using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
 the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
 your programs, too.

 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
 if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
 in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

 To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
 these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you
 have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software,
 or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

 For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
 gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
 freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
 or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
 know their rights.

 Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
 (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
 giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

 For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
 that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
 authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
 changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
 authors of previous versions.

 Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
 patents.  States should not allow patents to restrict development and
 use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we
 wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program
 could make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL
 assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.

 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
 a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
 under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
 refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
 means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
 that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
 either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
 language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
 the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
 running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
 is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
 Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
 Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
 source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
 conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
 copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
 notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
 and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
 along with the Program.

 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
 you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
 of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

   a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
   stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

   b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
   whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
   thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
   under the terms of this License.

   c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
   when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
   interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
   announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
   that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
   warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
   conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
   (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
   normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
   is not required to print an announcement.)

 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
 under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
 Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

   a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
   source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
   1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;

   b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
   years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
   cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
   machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
   distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
   customarily used for software interchange; or

   c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
   to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
   allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received
   the program in object code or executable form with such an offer,
   in accord with Subsection b above.)

 The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
 code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
 associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
 control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
 special exception, the source code distributed need not include
 anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
 form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
 operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
 itself accompanies the executable.

 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
 except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
 otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
 void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
 However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
 this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
 parties remain in full compliance.

 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
 signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
 distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
 modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
 Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
 Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
 original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
 these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
 restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.

 7. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
 original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
 may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
 those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
 countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
 the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

 8. The program is provided "as is" without any warranty; without even
 the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the
 program is with you.  Should the program prove defective, you assume
 the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.

 9. In no event unless required by law or agreed to in writing will any
 copyright holder, or any other party who modifies and/or conveys the
 program as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including
 any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out
 of the use or inability to use the program (including but not limited
 to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained
 by you or third parties or a failure of the program to operate with
 any other programs), even if such holder or other party has been
 advised of the possibility of such damages.

 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
 programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
 author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the
 Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
 sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the
 two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
 software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

 Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
 States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
 software on general-purpose computers; patents applied to a free program
 could make it proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
 patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
 license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

 If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
 free software which everyone can redistribute and change.  To do so,
 attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach
 them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the
 exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the copyright
 line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

   <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
   Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

   This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
   it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
   the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
   (at your option) any later version.

   This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
   but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
   MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
   GNU General Public License for more details.

   You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
   along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
   Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.
